# Autostart
A universal autostart controller for MEP-1030, MEP-1040, MEP-1050, MEP-1060, and MEP-1070... for now.

Meant to be mounted inside the DCS of the genset. This allows for the ratings to remain intact for the unit. Uses only unused pins on the front panel and internal pins for the sensing. 

At current this is just a spit-ball project that I thought of while working in my office to have a remote start.
